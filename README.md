# Robocon 2023 - ABU Asia-Pacific Robotics Competition

Welcome to the **Robocon 2023** repository! This project represents our team's efforts in the **Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) Robocon competition**. Our goal was to design and build robots capable of solving a unique problem statement as part of the multi-stage competition.

## Competition Overview

The **ABU Robocon** is an annual robotics competition that invites teams from the Asia-Pacific region to solve a specific technical challenge. For 2023, the problem statement involved constructing two robots that can:
- **Pick up rubber rings** stacked on the ground
- **Throw the rings** onto poles/pillars set in a competition arena

This repository includes code, hardware designs, and technical documentation for the robots we developed.

## Project Highlights
- Achieved a score of **98/100** in the Stage-1 report submission, the **highest score among all IITs**.
- Advanced through Stage-2 to the **national-level competition** held in **New Delhi**.
- Core contributions included:
  - **Hardware development**: Mechanical design and assembly.
  - **Control systems**: Stepper motor and servo motor control.
  - **Structural analysis**: Stress analysis for mechanical components.

## Repository Structure

- `/robocon/cad/assem2.SLDASM`: Assembly file of the robot in SolidWorks format, used for hardware design and simulation.
- `/control_code`: Codebase for controlling the stepper motors, servo motors, and actuators.
- `/simulations`: Stress analysis and structural simulations of the robot.
- `/documentation`: Reports submitted for various stages of the competition, including technical summaries and notes.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CoderXAyush/Robocon-23.git
   ```
2. Access the relevant folders based on your area of interest:
   - **CAD Designs**: View the mechanical assembly in the `robocon/cad/assem2.SLDASM` file.
   - **Control Code**: Explore the code for motor control and robot automation.
   - **Simulations**: Analyze the stress and structural integrity of the design.

## Prerequisites

- **SolidWorks**: Required to open and modify the CAD file (`assem2.SLDASM`).
